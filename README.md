# Util

Util is a simple but very useful web application for everyday situations. It has three basic functions: a rule of three calculator, a tool to transform dates into timestamps and another to transform timestamps into dates.

It was developed using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript, without the need for libraries or frameworks. It is completely open source and is available on Github for anyone who wants to contribute to the project.

## Rule of Three Calculator

The rule of three calculator is a useful tool for those who need to do ratio calculations. The user enters the known values and the application returns the unknown value according to the proportion. It is a simple tool, but very useful in everyday situations.

##Transform date into timestamp

The second feature of Util is the conversion of dates to timestamps. A timestamp is a way to represent a date in seconds from a base date, facilitating calculations and comparisons between dates. The user enters the date and the application returns the corresponding timestamp.

## Transform timestamp into date

The third feature of Util is the conversion of timestamps to dates. The user informs the timestamp and the application returns the corresponding date.

## How to use
